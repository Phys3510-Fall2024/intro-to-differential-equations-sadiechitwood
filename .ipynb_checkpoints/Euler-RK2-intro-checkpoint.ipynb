    "[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) was a Swiss mathematician whose contributions laid the foundations for much of modern calculus and analysis. What is now called the [Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) was one of the first attempts to numerically solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It was developed to address mechanical problems, such as predicting the motion of planets or pendulums.\n",

    "## Carl Runge (1856–1927) and Martin Wilhelm Kutta (1867–1944)\n",
    "[Carl Runge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Runge) and [Martin Wilhelm Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kutta) were German mathematicians who improved Euler's method to create more accurate numerical solutions. (Runge was also a physicist and spectroscopist.) Kutta was trying to solve for atomic spectra, while Runge was interested in an aerofoil. The Runge-Kutta methods, including the RK2 and RK4 methods, use intermediate slope calculations to reduce error, making them essential tools for solving complex, [stiff differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_equation)."
